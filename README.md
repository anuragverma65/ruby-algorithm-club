# Ruby Algorithm Club

Inspired by [Swift Algorithm Club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club), the aim is to write pure ruby implementations of data structures and algorithms that you like. All code here works on Ruby 2.2.1 . Please note everything here is work-in-progress! :)

## Contributing

We're using issues to track implementations written by members so please check if an issue for the same has already been made and if it has been assigned. If your favorite algorithm/ data structure's issue is not present, feel free to add it and assign to yourself!
In addition to creating a collection of pure ruby implementation of algorithms/DS the idea is to understand them well and be a central resource for someone who wishes to learn how it works. In addition to your code, please provide test cases and a small writeup explaining the idea behind your implementation.

We feel [Coala](https://github.com/coala/coala) as an organization has nailed how to go about commit messages and PR etiquette. Please follow this [guide](http://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Good_Commits.html) for writing commits.

Happy coding! :)
